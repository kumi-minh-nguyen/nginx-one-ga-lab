## Manually Configure NGINX Plus

The NGINX One Console supports both NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS. Both products leverage the NGINX Agent to communicate with the NGINX One Console API.
The UDF blueprint contains a Ubuntu host with NGINX Plus installed.  In this section we will install NGINX Agent and connect this instance to the NGINX One Console.

### Generating a Data Plane Key

Since you were instructed to revoke your Data Plane Key at the end of the previous lab, you will need to generate a new one.

1. From the NGINX One Console, in the left hand menu under the "Manage" section, select **Data Plane Keys**.

1. Click **Add Data Plane Key**.

1. Give the key a name based on your lab's ephemeral name, such as **<GetVariable name="petname" />-nginx-key**

    > :point_right: **Note:** You are working in a shared environment; keep track of your resources, and be careful not to accidentally modify anyone else's.

1. By default, the key expiration date will be set to 1 year.  Depending on your use case, you may want to set a shorter expiration date.  For this lab, we will use the default value.

1. Click **Generate**.

1. The Data Plane Key will be displayed. Click the *Copy* icon to copy the key to the clipboard.

    > :warning: **Warning:** *SAVE THIS KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE.* There is no way to retrieve the key after you click **close**. This key will be used until the completion of this lab.

### Create a Config Sync Group

1. Create a Config Sync Group called **<GetVariable name="petname" />-manual** based on what you learned earlier in the lab. Note this name, as you will need it in the commands you run below.

### Installing NGINX Agent on NGINX Plus

1. Connect to the "NGINX Plus" instance in UDF through the Web Shell access method by clicking the *Open Web Shell* button below:

    <UDFComponent
        name="NGINX Plus"
    />

1. Because the hostname is used as the name of the instance in the NGINX One Console, you should change the hostname to something that identifies it as yours, such as **<GetVariable name="petname" />-ubuntu-plus**.
Ensure that you are working on the NGINX Plus instance (default hostname ip-10.1.1.4), and run the following command below using only lowercase characters and hyphens.

    > **Note:** The bash prompt will continue to show the previous hostname unless you log out and log back in. This does not affect the lab.

        ```bash
        sudo hostnamectl set-hostname {{petname}}-ubuntu-plus
        ```

1. From the NGINX Plus instance, run the following command to install the NGINX Agent, and automatically join the
Config Sync Group you created above. In the command below, take the following actions:

    - Substitute **data-plane-key** with the Data Plane Key you created above.
    - Confirm the **Config Sync Group Name** (the variable after the **-c** switch) is the name of the Config Sync Group you just created above.

    ```bash
    curl https://agent.connect.nginx.com/nginx-agent/install | DATA_PLANE_KEY='data-plane-key' sh -s -- -y -c {{petname}}-manual
    ```

    > Note: Make sure you are working on the NGINX Plus instance; if you accidentally install on the **Lab Framework**, the installation will succeed, but there will be no NGINX instance for the agent to connect to and the instance will appear as "Offline". If this occurs, return to the [directions in lab 1](nginx-one-1.mdx#generating-a-data-plane-key) to create a new Data Plane Key.

    The install script will install any necessary dependencies, and install the NGINX Agent with the appropriate settings for your system. You will see a warning about "stub_status" not being configured. You can ignore that warning, as we are not using any features that currently require it.

1. Return to the NGINX One Console. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click *Instances*. You should see your new instance in the list.

1. Click its hostname to view the instance details.

    ![Instance list](media/part3-01.png)

1. Explore the instance details.

    ![Instance Details](media/part3-02.png)

    <APICheck
    url="http://10.1.1.4"
    targetStatusCode={200}
    />


1. Return to NGINX ONE console, open the configuration view of the instance and examine the file **api_gateway.conf**. This config defines several API endpoints with different accessing rules. Upon understanding, open the NGINX Plus Web Shell to test these endpoints with curl commands:

    <UDFComponent
        name="NGINX Plus"
    />


 ```bash
 # SSL Termination
 curl -k -v https://10.1.1.4:8443/get | jq && echo
 curl -k https://10.1.1.4:8443/api/f1/drivers?year=2019 | jq && echo

 # API Key, correct key returns data, wrong key will deny access

## Manually Configure NGINX in Docker

The **Lab Framework** from the UDF environment has **docker** installed and is setup so it can run an NGINX Plus container image. The container image we will use here is **private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian** which has NGINX Plus with the Agent. If you want to see a list of all NGINX Plus with Agent image tags, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-docker/#pulling-the-image).

1. In the NGINX One Console, go to the *Details* page of the last Config Sync Group you created.

1. Click *Add Instance to Config Sync Group*.

1. Select *Register a new instance with NGINX One then add to config sync group*, then click *Next*.

1. If you saved your Data Plane Key from a previous lab, select *Use existing Key*. Otherwise select *Generate new key*.

1. Provide your Data Plane Key if you selected *Use existing Key*.

1. Select the *Docker Container* tab.

    ![Add New NGINX Plus Container](media/part3-03.png)

    > **Note:** This system already cached the container image, so Steps 1 and 2 from the image above can be skipped.

1. Open a Web Shell to the **Lab Framework** UDF instance and start an NGINX Plus container with the commands to join it to your Config Sync Group.

    <UDFComponent
        name="Lab Framework"
    />

1. Execute the *docker run* command outlined in Step 6 to start the NGINX Plus with Agent container. For the shell
command below, take the following actions:

    - Substitute **data-plane-key** with the Data Plane Key you created above.
    - Confirm **NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP** is set using the name of the Config Sync Group you just created above.

    > **Note:** Notice the extra argument where we are mapping the container's port **80** to the host's port **8080**.

    ```shell
    sudo docker run \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_GRPCPORT=443 \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_HOST=agent.connect.nginx.com \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP={{petname}}-manual \
    --env=NMS_TLS_ENABLE=true \
    --restart=always \
    --runtime=runc \
    -p 8080:80 \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_TOKEN="data-plane-key" \
    -d private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian
    ```

1. In the NGINX One Console, navigate to *Instances*. You will see a new NGINX Plus instance added to the NGINX One Console. This instance will be randomly named based on the Docker container that was created, since a name was not provided.

    ![Container instance in list](media/part3-04.png)

1. Use the API Check below to ensure that the NGINX instance is responding.

    <APICheck
    url="http://10.1.1.7:8080"
    targetStatusCode={200}
    />


## Review

Great job! You successfully added NGINX Instances to NGINX One Console by following instructions given from the console itself!
You added an NGINX Virtual Machine instance and an NGINX container instance!

## Cleanup

Time to clean up the resources you created in this part of the lab. As a safety precaution, the NGINX One Console will not allow you to delete an instance that is online. We will first have to shut down the instances before deleting them from the NGINX One Console.

1. In the UDF deployment for this lab, click *Details* for the **NGINX Plus** component.

    ![Select the NGINX component details](media/cleanup-01.png)

1. Click the **Stop** button for this component.

    ![Select the NGINX component details](media/cleanup-02.png)


1. Open a Web Shell to the **Lab Framework** UDF instance.

    <UDFComponent
        name="Lab Framework"
    />

1. Remove the NGINX Plus container using the command below with the following substitution:

    - Substitute **container-id** with the hostname of the Docker container NGINX Plus instance appearing in the
    *Instances* list of the NGINX One Console.
      - Hint: You saw it in Step 9 of the previous section.
      - Hint: You can also find this by running **docker ps**

    ```shell
    docker rm -f container-id
    ```

1. From the NGINX One Console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Instances*.

1. Wait until your **<GetVariable name="petname" />-ubuntu-plus** and Docker container instance transition into the **Unavailable** state before proceeding. You may need to click the *Refresh* button at the top right of the instance list.

1. On each of your instances, select the *Actions* "..." context menu, and select
    *Delete*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are deleting your own instances and not someone else’s.

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-05.png)

1. From the NGINX One Console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Delete your **<GetVariable name="petname" />-manual** Config Sync Group by selecting the *Actions* "..." context menu, then select *Delete*.

    ![Delete Config Sync Group](media/cleanup-08.png)

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-09.png)
